# Mel::Scene::Fsm

The whole point of this gem is to extract and ecapsulate the FSM system for switching scenes in a console application.

This is only a winner if it is easy to make sets of FSM's that can switch between each other and encapsulate functionality.

Test looks promising, now to use it to refactor mobilis
